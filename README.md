# julia-var-logger

This program can take as input a file to append logging material; however, it is recommended to add this to a vim config so that you can easily run it.
Running the below command will add the program to ~/.bin and append a vim keybind ( space + j ).
```
curl | bash
```

Feel free to add requests and stuff, I'm pretty happy to add whatever mostly. One thing to note is that this is made for single function files, so if you have multiple functions in one file you're going to run into some issues. You can fix it or ask me to :)
